# Web Interface vs. Direct Script Approach

This document explains the purpose of the Wireshark MCP web interface and helps you decide which approach to use for your PCAP analysis needs.

## Two Paths to Claude Analysis

Wireshark MCP offers two primary methods to analyze PCAP files with Claude:

### 1. Direct Script Approach

The simplest and most direct path from PCAP file to Claude analysis:

```bash
python scripts/simple_pcap_analysis.py path/to/your/capture.pcap
```

This script extracts the essential information from your PCAP file, formats it appropriately for Claude, and saves a markdown file that you can copy and paste directly into Claude at claude.ai.

**Best for:**
- Command-line comfortable users
- Quick, straightforward analysis
- One-off analyses
- Scripting and automation
- Users who prefer minimal setup

### 2. Web Interface Approach

A graphical interface that provides a more visual experience:

```bash
cd web_interface
python app.py
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

**Best for:**
- Users less comfortable with command-line tools
- Teams with varying technical expertise
- Guided analysis workflows
- Reusing analysis templates
- Future integration with Claude API

## Why Have a Web Interface?

While the direct script approach is sufficient for many users, the web interface serves several important purposes:

1. **Accessibility**: Makes the tool accessible to analysts who may not be comfortable with command-line tools or Python scripts

2. **Guided Experience**: Provides a step-by-step workflow that guides users through the analysis process

3. **Visual Feedback**: Offers visual cues and feedback during the analysis process

4. **Future Extensibility**: Forms the foundation for more advanced features:
   - Direct Claude API integration
   - Interactive visualizations
   - Analysis history and templates
   - Collaborative analysis
   - Custom query builders

5. **Protocol Selection**: Allows for point-and-click selection of protocols to focus on

## Choosing the Right Approach

| If you... | Consider Using |
|-----------|----------------|
| Are comfortable with command line | Direct Script Approach |
| Prefer visual interfaces | Web Interface |
| Need to automate analysis | Direct Script Approach |
| Work with less technical team members | Web Interface |
| Want the simplest possible workflow | Direct Script Approach |
| Plan to extend functionality | Web Interface |

## The Future of the Web Interface

The web interface is being actively developed and will gain additional features over time, including:

- More interactive visualizations
- Direct API integration with Claude
- Analysis history and favorites
- Comparison views for multiple PCAP files
- Custom query templates
- Collaborative analysis capabilities

However, we remain committed to maintaining and improving the direct script approach for users who prefer simplicity and command-line efficiency.
